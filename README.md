# Data-Analysis-of-Cars-using-python

Data Analysis or sometimes referred to as exploratory data analysis (EDA) is one of the core components of data science. It is also the part on which data scientists, data engineers and data analysts spend their majority of the time which makes it extremely important in the field of data science. This repository demonstartes some common exploratory data analysis methods and techniques using python. For purpose of illustration the [CARSSSS.csv](https://github.com/Muskaanbafna/Data-Analysis-of-Cars-using-python/files/8793819/CARSSSS.csv) has been taken from kaggle since it is one of the ideal dataset for performing EDA and taking a step towards the most amazing and interesting field of data science.

DataSet Overview
The dataset is taken from kaggle and contains details of the used cars in germany which are on sale on ebay.
The dataset is not clean and hence a lot of data cleaning is carried out.
The dataset is cleaned and stored in a CleanData folder which contains the entire cleaned dataset named [as cleaned_autos.csv and another folder named DataForAnalysis containing files structures containing subsets of the cleaned dataset based on brand of the vehicles and vehicle types.](https://github.com/Muskaanbafna/Data-Analysis-of-Cars-using-python/tree/main/CleanedData/clean%20data)


Analysis 1 

Data Cleaning 

Some general analysis encountered during Data Cleaning are:

Checking the type of data

Dropping the duplicate rows

Dropping the missing or null values

Data after dropping the values



ANALYSIS 2

This analysis gives the distribution of cars on Car type,Make,Fuel type.

Box plot of Price of every body type.

Performing a 5 number summary (min, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, max)

An outlier is a point or set of points different from other points. Sometimes they can be very high or very low. Itâ€™s often a good idea to detect and remove the outliers.

Therefore to remove outliners IQR score technique is used  to detect and remove the outliers with the help of boxplot
.
After using this technique we will see that  box plot contains no outlier points.


ANALYSIS 3

This analysis gives us the relation between Mileage and price.

Relation between power and price considering different body type.

Heapmap is used to find the correlation between the features.

Scatter plot grid of more numerical variable is done to  investigate the realtion in more detail


ANALYSIS 4

Univariant Analysis is done between:
Cylinders
Displacement
Wheelbase
Fuel_Tank_Capacity
Power
Price

Bivariant Analysis is done between:

Price,Make 
Model,Make of cars.
Correlation between the features of cars is done to get indepth analysis.

Seabron catplot provides access to several axes-level functions that show the relationship between a numerical and one or more categorical variables.

Seaborn Catplot is shown between Make , Price , Type of cars.

Pairplot helps to form some simple classification models by drawing some simple lines or make linear separation in the data-set.

Pairplot between Fuel_Tank_Capacity,Displacement,Price,Power is shown 

ANALYSIS 5

The method of Clustering is used in Analysis 5

The type of clustering used here is k-means clustering k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. k-means clustering minimizes within-cluster variances (squared Euclidean distances)
Creating and visualizing the data is done.

Scatter plot of Fuel tank capacity and Cylinders with clusters is shown.

Interactive 3D scatter plot of Price,power, and Fuel tank capacity using  clusters is shown.
