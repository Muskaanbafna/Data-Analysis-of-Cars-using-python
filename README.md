Performing a 5 number summary (min, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, max)

An outlier is a point or set of points different from other points. Sometimes they can be very high or very low. Itâ€™s often a good idea to detect and remove the outliers.

Therefore to remove outliners IQR score technique is used  to detect and remove the outliers with the help of boxplot
.
After using this technique we will see that  box plot contains no outlier points.


ANALYSIS 3

This analysis gives us the relation between Mileage and price.

Relation between power and price considering different body type.

Heapmap is used to find the correlation between the features.
